# Detection-and-Prediction-of-Tennis-Ball-Throws

Ball detection and tracking in Broadcast Tennis Video (BTV) is a challenging task in tennis video semantic analysis. Informally, the challenges are due to the camera motion and the other causes such as the small size of the tennis ball and many objects resembles like ball, while the player, the human body along with the tennis racket is not detected completely. In this document proposed an improved object tracking technique in BTV. In order to track the ball, image diﬀerence is performed and because of fast movement of ball its shape didn’t looks like a circle. So an equation is used to detect circle type objects from that the ball candidates are detected by applying threshold values and dilated. Finally the ball is tracked. Then we used Kalman Filter to predict the next position of the ball. The experimental result shows the proposed approach achieved the higher accuracy in object identiﬁcation, and their tracking. It is achieved a high hit rate and less fail rate for ball tracking.
